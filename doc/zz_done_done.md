# Completely finished tasks . Working features

----

Load a PNG image and place a grid on top of it.

- choose mosaic dimensions, for the image
- choose basic (square) tessera dimensions, for the grid.

----

Load JPEG images also.

(and, other kind of image formats ?)

----

Initial mosaic dimensions (in mm) equal to image dimensions (in pixels), rounded to the upper nearest tens. 

Interesting to be able to do this kind of matching between image and mosaic dimensions. Whatever mosaic dimension the user put on the interface, round it to the upper nearest hundred; to match proportion to the one between the image dimensions.

But also is interesting to permit arbitrary mosaic dimensions (distorted repesentation) if the user chooses to do that.

Pan the display
