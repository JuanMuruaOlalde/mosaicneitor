Initial mosaic dimensions (in mm) equal to image dimensions (in pixels), rounded to the upper nearest tens. 

Interesting to be able to do this kind of matching between image and mosaic dimensions. Whatever mosaic dimension the user put on the interface, round it to the upper nearest hundred; to match proportion to the one between the image dimensions.

But also is interesting ? to permit arbitrary mosaic dimensions (distorted repesentation) if the user chooses to do that.
