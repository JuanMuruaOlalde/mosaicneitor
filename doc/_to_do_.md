# work cards, reminders and notes

----

Pan (scroll) the display if it doesn't fit on the window.

----

Allow display to jump between two modes:
- show image, and tesserae on top of it.
- show only tesserae, without the underline image.

----

Pick and change color, for any given tessera. 

Start assigning each tessera the general background color on the image under it ?

The color can be picked from:
- A spot on the underlining image.
- A palette of available tessera colors.

Ask the user to save the mosaic before start editing it. 
In order to confirm that she/he is ok with the dimensions and size.
(Any change in dimensions or size changes the mosaic base structure
 and restarts all color/shape assigments.)

----

Pick and change shape, for any given tessera. 

To mimic cuts.
