# work cards, reminders and notes

----

Load a PNG image and place a grid on top of it.

- choose mosaic dimensions, for the image
- choose basic (square) tessera dimensions, for the grid.

----

Initial mosaic dimensions (in mm) equal to image dimensions (in pixels), rounded to the upper nearest hundred. 

Interesting to be able to do this kind of matching between image and mosaic dimensions. Whatever mosaic dimension the user put on the interface, round it to the upper nearest hundred; to match proportion to the one between the image dimensions.

But also is interesting ? to permit arbitrary mosaic dimensions (distorted repesentation) if the user chooses to do that.

----

Zoom the display

----

Pick and change color, for any given tessera. 

Start assigning each tessera the general background color on the image under it ?

The color can be picked from:
- A spot on the underlining image.
- A palette of available tessera colors.

The display must jump easily between two modes:
- show image, and tesserae on top of it.
- show only tesserae, without the underline image.

----

Pick and change shape, for any given tessera. 

To mimic cuts.
